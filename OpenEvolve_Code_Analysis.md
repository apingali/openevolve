# OpenEvolve: Code Analysis and Applications

OpenEvolve is a sophisticated evolutionary coding agent that leverages Large Language Models to iteratively improve programs through natural selection principles. Here's how it works and can be applied across different scenarios:

## How OpenEvolve Works

### Core Architecture

**1. Evolution Controller (`controller.py`)**
- Orchestrates the entire evolutionary process
- Manages generations, iterations, and checkpoint saves
- Coordinates between LLM generation, evaluation, and database storage
- Implements island-based evolution for diversity maintenance

**2. Program Database (`database.py`)**
- Stores evolved programs using MAP-Elites algorithm
- Maintains population diversity through feature-based binning
- Implements island model with migration between populations
- Tracks the absolute best program to prevent loss of good solutions

**3. LLM Integration**
- Supports ensemble of models with weighted selection
- Uses prompt engineering with context from previous programs
- Can operate in diff-based mode (incremental changes) or full rewrites

**4. Evaluation System**
- Executes generated code in sandboxed environments
- Supports cascade evaluation (quick filtering → full evaluation)
- Captures artifacts (errors, profiling data) for LLM feedback

### Evolution Process

1. **Initialization**: Start with a seed program marked with `EVOLVE-BLOCK-START/END` tags
2. **Selection**: Sample parent program and inspiration programs from database
3. **Generation**: LLM creates modified code based on prompt with context
4. **Evaluation**: Execute and score the new program
5. **Integration**: Add successful programs to database, update population
6. **Migration**: Periodically share best solutions between islands

## Application Scenarios

### 1. **Mathematical Optimization**

**Example: Function Minimization**
```python
# Initial simple random search
for _ in range(iterations):
    x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])
    y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])
    value = evaluate_function(x, y)
    if value < best_value:
        best_value = value
        best_x, best_y = x, y
```

**Evolved: Sophisticated optimization algorithms**
- Simulated annealing with adaptive cooling
- Gradient-based optimization
- Multi-start strategies with local search

**Applications:**
- Parameter tuning for machine learning models
- Engineering design optimization
- Financial portfolio optimization

### 2. **Symbolic Regression & Scientific Discovery**

**Example: LLM-SRBench Integration**
```python
# Initial linear model
def func(x, params):
    return x[:, 0] * params[0] + x[:, 1] * params[1] + x[:, 2] * params[2]
```

**Evolved: Complex mathematical expressions**
```python
# Discovered nonlinear dynamics
restoring = -(params[0] * pos + params[1] * pos**3)
forcing = params[2] * np.cos(params[3] * t_val) + params[4] * np.sin(params[5] * t_val)
interaction = params[8] * pos * t_val
return restoring + forcing + interaction + params[9]
```

**Applications:**
- Physics equation discovery
- Biological system modeling  
- Chemical reaction kinetics
- Material science property prediction

### 3. **Geometric & Combinatorial Problems**

**Example: Circle Packing**
- Started with simple concentric ring placement
- Evolved through grid-based approaches
- Culminated in mathematical optimization using `scipy.optimize`
- Achieved 99.97% of AlphaEvolve paper's result (2.634 vs 2.635)

**Applications:**
- Packing and scheduling problems
- Graph algorithms optimization
- Computational geometry
- Resource allocation

### 4. **Algorithm Development**

**Competitive Programming**
- Evolve efficient algorithms for contest problems
- Optimize time/space complexity
- Discover novel algorithmic approaches

**Data Structures**
- Evolve custom data structures for specific use cases
- Optimize memory layouts and access patterns

### 5. **Domain-Specific Code Evolution**

**Game AI**
```python
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
def evaluate_position(board, player):
    # Initial: simple piece counting
    return sum(1 for piece in board if piece == player)
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END
```

Could evolve into sophisticated evaluation functions with:
- Positional analysis
- Tactical pattern recognition  
- Strategic planning

**Signal Processing**
- Evolve filter designs

- Develop feature extraction methods

## Key Configuration Patterns

### For Mathematical Optimization
```yaml
database:
  population_size: 500
  exploitation_ratio: 0.7  # High exploitation for convergence
  feature_dimensions: ["score", "complexity"]

llm:
  temperature: 0.5  # Lower for more focused improvements
```

### For Creative Discovery
```yaml
database:
  population_size: 1000
  exploration_ratio: 0.4  # Higher exploration
  num_islands: 8  # More diversity

llm:
  temperature: 0.8  # Higher for creative solutions
```

### For Performance Optimization
```yaml
evaluator:
  enable_cascade_evaluation: true
  timeout: 30  # Longer for complex algorithms
  
prompt:
  include_artifacts: true  # Learn from errors
```

## Advantages & Unique Features

1. **Arbitrary Code Evolution**: Unlike traditional genetic programming, works with full programming languages
2. **LLM-Powered**: Leverages human-like coding knowledge and patterns
3. **Context-Aware**: Uses best programs and failure artifacts as inspiration
4. **Multi-Objective**: MAP-Elites maintains diversity across multiple dimensions
5. **Scalable**: Island model prevents premature convergence
6. **Resumable**: Checkpoint system allows long-running experiments

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic working implementation
2. **Clear Evaluation**: Define precise, measurable objectives
3. **Proper Blocks**: Mark only the code that should evolve
4. **Iterative Approach**: Use multiple phases with different configurations
5. **Artifact Learning**: Enable error feedback for faster convergence
6. **Population Diversity**: Use islands and feature dimensions appropriately

## Technical Deep Dive

### MAP-Elites Algorithm Implementation

OpenEvolve uses MAP-Elites to maintain a diverse population across multiple behavioral dimensions:

```python
# Feature dimensions from config
feature_dimensions: ["score", "complexity", "diversity"]

# Each program gets binned into a feature map
def _calculate_feature_coords(self, program):
    coords = []
    for dim in self.config.feature_dimensions:
        if dim == "complexity":
            bin_idx = min(int(len(program.code) / 1000 * self.feature_bins), 
                         self.feature_bins - 1)
        elif dim == "score":
            avg_score = safe_numeric_average(program.metrics)
            bin_idx = min(int(avg_score * self.feature_bins), self.feature_bins - 1)
        # ... other dimensions
    return coords
```

### Island Model Evolution

The island model maintains separate populations that evolve independently:

```python
# Multiple islands evolve separately
self.islands: List[Set[str]] = [set() for _ in range(config.num_islands)]
self.current_island: int = 0

# Periodic migration shares best solutions
def migrate_programs(self):
    for i, island in enumerate(self.islands):
        # Select top programs for migration
        island_programs.sort(key=lambda p: p.metrics.get("combined_score"))
        migrants = island_programs[:num_to_migrate]
        
        # Migrate to adjacent islands (ring topology)
        target_islands = [(i + 1) % len(self.islands), (i - 1) % len(self.islands)]
```

### Artifacts Side-Channel

Programs can return execution context to help LLMs learn from failures:

```python
from openevolve.evaluation_result import EvaluationResult

return EvaluationResult(
    metrics={"compile_ok": 0.0, "score": 0.0},
    artifacts={
        "stderr": "SyntaxError: invalid syntax (line 15)",
        "traceback": "...",
        "failure_stage": "compilation"
    }
)
```

This feedback is included in subsequent prompts to guide improvements.

### Cascade Evaluation

For computationally expensive evaluations, OpenEvolve supports staged evaluation:

```python
# Stage 1: Quick validation
def evaluate_stage1(program_path):
    # Fast checks: syntax, basic functionality
    return {"runs_successfully": 1.0, "basic_score": 0.8}

# Stage 2: Full evaluation (only for promising programs)  
def evaluate_stage2(program_path):
    # Comprehensive testing with multiple trials
    return full_evaluation_metrics
```

## Real-World Success Stories

### Scientific Discovery: Symbolic Regression

OpenEvolve successfully discovered complex physics equations on the LLM-SRBench benchmark:

**Ground Truth (Physics Oscillator):**
```
F₀sin(t) - ω₀²(γt+1)x(t) - ω₀²x(t)³ - ω₀²x(t)
```

**OpenEvolve Discovery:**
```python
# Evolved symbolic expression
restoring = -(params[0] * pos + params[1] * pos**3)  # -ω₀²x(t) - ω₀²x(t)³
forcing = params[4] * np.sin(params[5] * t_val)      # F₀sin(t)  
interaction = params[8] * pos * t_val                # -ω₀²γt·x(t)
return restoring + forcing + interaction + params[9]
```

**Results on LLM-SRBench:**
- Chemistry: 2.34 × 10⁻⁶ NMSE (competitive with LLMSR)
- Physics: 1.85 × 10⁻⁵ NMSE  
- Out-of-distribution generalization maintained

### Mathematical Optimization: Circle Packing

Evolved from simple geometric construction to sophisticated optimization:

**Initial Approach:**
```python
# Simple concentric rings
centers[0] = [0.5, 0.5]  # Central circle
for i in range(8):
    angle = 2 * np.pi * i / 8
    centers[i + 1] = [0.5 + 0.3 * np.cos(angle), 0.5 + 0.3 * np.sin(angle)]
```

**Final Solution:**
```python
# Mathematical optimization discovery
def objective(x):
    centers = x[:2*n].reshape(n, 2)
    radii = x[2*n:]
    return -np.sum(radii)  # Maximize sum of radii

result = minimize(objective, x0, method='SLSQP', 
                 bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)
```

**Achievement:** 2.634 sum of radii (99.97% of AlphaEvolve paper's 2.635 result)

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Machine Learning Pipeline
```python
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
def feature_engineering(X):
    # Initial: basic features
    return np.column_stack([X, X**2])
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END

def train_model(X, y):
    features = feature_engineering(X)
    return LinearRegression().fit(features, y)
```

Could evolve sophisticated feature engineering pipelines with:
- Polynomial interactions
- Domain-specific transformations
- Automated feature selection

### Scientific Computing
```python
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START  
def numerical_solver(equation, initial_conditions):
    # Initial: simple Euler method
    return euler_method(equation, initial_conditions)
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END
```

Could discover advanced numerical methods:
- Adaptive step-size algorithms
- Higher-order methods
- Stability-preserving schemes
